# MATLAB-Code
MATLAB notes and code for Numerical Methods in Differential Equations.

My major is Computational Mathematics about Numerical Methods in Differential Equations. I write some MATLAB code, including Numerical Methods of ODEs, Finite Difference Methods, Finite Element Methods and Spectral Methods.

I upload my code on github to force myself to write something seriously. I will gradually upload my code.
