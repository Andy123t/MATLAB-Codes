# MATLAB-Code
MATLAB code for numerical methods in differential equations. Study notes on the [weblog](https://andy123t.github.io/).

My major is computational mathematics about numerical methods in differential equations. I write some MATLAB code, including numerical methods of ODEs, finite difference methods, finite element methods and spectral methods.

I upload some code to Github to force myself to write the program seriously. I will gradually update this repository.
