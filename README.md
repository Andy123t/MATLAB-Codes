# MATLAB-Code
MATLAB notes and code for numerical methods in differential equations.

My major is computational mathematics about numerical methods in differential equations. I write some MATLAB code, including numerical methods of ODEs, finite difference methods, finite element methods and spectral methods.

I upload my code on Github to force myself to write something serious. I will gradually upload my code.
