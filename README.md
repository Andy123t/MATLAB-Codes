# Numercial Methods for Partial Differential Equations

MATLAB code for numerical methods in differential equations. Related notes on the [weblog](https://andy123t.github.io/).

Numerical methods include numerical methods of ODEs, finite difference methods, finite element methods and spectral methods.

Code for spectral methods based on Book: [Spectral Methods: Algorithms, Analysis and Applications](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/wanglilian/book/).
